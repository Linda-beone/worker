This year we are going to hold the second graphene blockchain developer conference. Compared with the previous one, we will invite domestic first-line media to follow up the conference, focus on the latest development of graphene technology such as cross-chain and trusted computing, increase the display of blockchain application cases, and provide resource docking and social opportunities for participants. 

For the Devcon of last year, the cost was partly covered by sponsors and the rest was covered by ourselves, however, to make this event sustainable, we would like to ask the community to cover part of the cost this time. At the same time, we will also actively contact sponsors. If you think it is meaningful to hold such event annually in China, please show your support by voting for this proposal.
